# pins

## How long did it take you to complete the project?
I spent about 13 hours coding that project


## What part of this project did you find most challenging?
The most challenging parts for me were:
- Working with an API without any documentation about it, as it would be with any API with no documentation
- Moshi ended up not being that easy to set up
- Using Compose to fully develop the UI of the app
- Date formatting and parsing in Java is always interesting


## If you used 3rd party libraries, explain for each one the reason for introducing that dependency and how you selected that particular library.
- Moshi to parse Json payload
- Retrofit to handle API calls
- Firebase for GoogleMap and Performance

## Given 8 more hours, how would you improve your project?
I would improve the UI/UX in many ways:
- a loading state while loading the data
- a selected state for the pin
- the current bottom sheet layout is quite simple and could be improved
- the content description should not be static but localized
- add a pin clustering approach on the map

Also I would love to look into a better implementation possibly of the redux approach in Kotlin with Compose.
